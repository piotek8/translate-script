# Internet

Here we will discuss various issues related to the network, the Internet, and everything else. Despite the fact as a junior-python wannabe we are most concerned about Python itself and programming, we should remember that the code we write and then execute does not work in a vacuum. 

All our web apps, programs etc. are run in a specific environment. This environment affects the execution of our programs, how they work. In addition, we often need to interact with it in some way, often mutual. What does it mean? Well, in addition to our own Python, it's good to know the whole environment where it goes and so on, otherwise, you can occasionally shoot yourself in the foot. In addition, knowledge of the environment and related things, which we use directly or indirectly, often without realizing it, which is simply other components of the `System` that we design, create or maintain, are its integral part as well as something that affects our work and our code.

By System, I mean some arrangement, a set of elements. In IT, it is usually, for example, our web app, servers where it is run, a client, etc.

Let's talk about this whole system and the environment.

## Request path

Most web applications operate in a client-server model. The client makes requests to the server, the server returns a response. 

However, how does it happen that we are able to send this request? What happens at the moment when you type `grski.pl` in the browser bar and then you see my blog?

Well, in addition to our Python, it is worth knowing the whole environment where it all happens and so on, otherwise, you can sometimes shoot yourself in the foot. In addition, knowledge about the environment and related things, which we indirectly or directly use, often without realizing it, that is simply other components of the `System` that we design, create or maintain, are an integral part of it as well as something that affects our work and our code.

By System here I mean some system, a set of elements. In IT, it is usually, for example, our web app, servers where it is run, client, etc.

So let's talk about this whole system and environment.

## The path of a request

Most web applications work in a client-server model. The client makes requests to the server, the server returns a response.

However, how is it possible that we are able to send this request. What happens when you type `grski.pl` into your browser's address bar and then see my blog?

# Internet

Here we will discuss various issues related to the network, the Internet, and everything else. Although, as a junior-python wannabe, we are most concerned about Python itself and the programming, it is worth remembering that the code we write and then run does not operate in a vacuum. 

All of our web apps, programs, etc., are run in a specific environment. This environment influences the execution of our programs, how they work. In addition, we often have to interact with it in some way, often mutually. What does this mean? Well, apart from our Python, it's good to also know the whole framework where it all works and so on, otherwise, we can sometimes shoot ourselves in the foot. To this, knowledge about the environment and related things, which we indirectly or directly use, often without being aware, other components of the `System` we design, create, or maintain, are its integral part and something that affects our work and our code.

By System, I mean some kind of arrangement, a set of elements. In IT, it is usually, for example, our web app, servers where it is run, clients, etc.

Let's talk about this whole system and environment.

## Request Journey

Most web applications operate in a client - server model. The client makes requests to the server, the server gives a response. 

But how exactly does it happen that we are able to send this request? What happens at the moment when you type `grski.pl` into your browser's bar and then see my blog?

# Internet

Here we will discuss various issues related to the network, Internet and all the rest. Despite the fact that as a junior-python wannabe we are most concerned about Python itself and programming, it is important to remember that the code we write and then run does not operate in a vacuum.

All our web apps, programs etc. are run in a specific environment. This environment affects the way our programs are executed, how they work. Additionally, we often have to interact with it in some way, often bilateral. What does this mean? Well, besides our Python, we should also be familiar with the whole environment where it all takes place and so on, because otherwise we might sometimes shoot ourselves in the foot. In addition, knowledge about the environment and related matters, which we use directly or indirectly, often without being aware of it, i.e. simply other components of the `System` we design, create or maintain, are an integral part of it as well as something that affects our work and our code.

## Request path

However, how do we manage to send this request. What happens at the moment when you type `grski.pl` in your browser bar and then you see my blog?

# Internet

Here we will discuss various issues related to the network, the Internet, and everything else. Despite that, as a junior-python wannabe, we are most worried about Python itself and programming, it's worth remembering that the code we write and then run doesn't operate in a vacuum.

All our web apps, programs, etc. are run in a specific environment. This environment influences the way our programs execute and how they function. In addition, we often need to interact with it in some way, often reciprocally. What does this mean? Well, aside from Python itself, we should also know the whole environment where it all happens and so on, otherwise, we can inadvertently trip ourselves up. Further, knowledge about the environment and related things that we indirectly or directly benefit from - often without being aware of them - and other components of the `System` which we design, create or maintain, are an integral part of it and something that affects our work and our code.

By System, I mean some structure or a set of elements. In IT, this is typically, for example, our web app, the servers where it is run, the client, etc.

So let's talk about this whole system and environment.

All our web apps, programs, etc., are run in a specific environment. This environment affects the way our programs execute, the way they work. Additionally, we often have to interact with it, often mutually. What does this mean? Well, besides our Python, it's good to know the entire periphery where it bangs and so on, because otherwise you can sometimes shoot yourself in the foot.

# Internet

Here we will discuss various issues related to the network, the Internet, and everything else. Even though as a junior-python wannabe most of our concerns are with Python and programming itself, we should remember that the code that we write and later execute does not operate in a vacuum. 

All of our web apps, programs, etc., are run in a specific environment. This environment influences the way our programs are executed and how they operate. Additionally, we often have to interact with it, often in a mutual way. What does this mean? Well, apart from Python, it's good to know the whole shebang where it bangs and so on, because otherwise, you might sometimes shoot yourself in the foot. Moreover, knowledge about the environment and related matters, which we indirectly or directly use, often without being aware, that is simply other components of the `System` that we design, create, or maintain, are an integral part of it as well as something that affects our work and our code.

By System, I mean here some arrangement, a set of elements. In IT, this is usually, for example, our web app, servers where it is run, a client, etc.

# Internet

Here we will discuss a wide variety of issues related to the network, the Internet, and everything else. Despite the fact that as a junior-python wannabe we are most concerned about Python itself and programming, it should be remembered that the code we write and then run does not operate in a vacuum. 

All our web apps, programs etc. are run in a specific environment. This environment impacts how our programs are executed, how they operate. Moreover, we often have to interact with it in a certain way, often a bilateral interaction. What does that mean? Well, besides our Python itself, it is also good to know the entire shell where it all happens and so on, because otherwise you can sometimes shoot yourself in the foot. In addition, knowledge about the environment and related things, which we indirectly or directly use, often without being aware of it, in other words simply other components of the `System` we are designing, creating or maintaining, are its integral part as well as something that affects our work and our code.
